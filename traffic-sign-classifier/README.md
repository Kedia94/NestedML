# Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classification
Modified code. Original code is https://github.com/ndrplz/self-driving-car/tree/master/project_2_traffic_sign_classifier

Changable variables
 - train.py:177 DO\_TRAIN
 - train.py:178 DO10
 - mynet.py:20  n
 - mynet.py:21  lnr

#### How to Run
```
python3 train.py
```

The goal of this project was  to build a **CNN** in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to **classify traffic sign images** from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

Main steps covered in this lab are:
- dataset exploration and visualization
- data augmentation
- deep network design and training 
- visualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions
